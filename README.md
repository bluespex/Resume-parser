# RESUME-PARSER
Resume Parser is a Web Application that will act as a bridge between the recruiters and candidates. We are trying to provide an application where a candidate can easily search for relevant job postings and where a recruiter can easily search the suitable candidates for the job, based on their skills and profiles. The app allows a user to upload his/her resume; this uploaded resume is then analysed and parsed using various regular expressions, pattern matching algorithms, and natural language processing-based algorithms. Using this feature, we extract relevant details of the user like their name, email address, mobile number, CGPA, skills, and his/her experience in the industry.

## Technologies Used

1.  React to design frontend 
2.  Python Flask to design backend and server 
3.  Regex (re library) and nlpt to detect various details of candidate from resume
4.  Firebase to maintain database of recruiters and candidates
